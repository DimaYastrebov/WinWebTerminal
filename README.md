# WinWebTerminal
### **What is WinWebTerminal**
- A second version of a web console that tries to emulate a real Windows (11 or 10) terminal.
### How do I use WinWebTerminal?
- It will be available for the near future (or for all time) at [the wwt subdomain of my web site](https://wwt.dimayastrebov.website) (click the mouse wheel to open in a new window). If the version is updated and it changes, don't forget to press ctrl + f5 when you access the page, the project is entirely in js, so it is cached by the browser!

## What are the limitations of WinWebTerminal?

WinWebTerminal has a few limitations that you should be aware of:
- WinWebTerminal does not have access to your actual file system or computer resources.
- WinWebTerminal does not support all the features and options of a real Windows terminal. For example, it does not support I/O redirection, channels, environment variables, command files, paths (they do not exist, but you can access them via `cd` (which is not yet implemented in the second version of the terminal)), etc.
